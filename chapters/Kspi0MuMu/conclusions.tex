\subsection{Conclusions}
\label{subsec:conclusions}
A precise measurement of the \Kspizmm branching fraction is crucial for a precise ${\cal B}(\PKzL\to\Pgpz\APmuon\Pmuon)$ SM theoretical prediction and the search for physics beyond the SM in ${\PKzL}\to\Pgpz\APmuon\Pmuon$.
The sensitivity of the LHCb experiment to \BRof\Kspizmm was studied based on $3\;\rm fb^{-1}$ of data recorded at 7 and $8\;\rm TeV$ center-of-mass energy during 2011 and 2012, and on $0.3\;\rm fb^{-1}$ 
of data recorded at $13\;\rm TeV$ center-of-mass energy during 2016. Full and partial decay reconstruction algorithms were considered, aiming at 
a high reconstruction efficiency. The sensitivity study was performed using pseudo-experiments by extrapolating signal yield results based on the currently available data to expected future integrated luminosities.
If a trigger efficiency of at least 50\% can be assured in the future, LHCb can determine \BRof\Kspizmm with a precision significantly better than that of NA48.
