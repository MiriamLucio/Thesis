\section{Main changes}
\label{sec:todo}

\begin{itemize}
\item Updated with Sim09 MC, which includes a specific theoretical model for \KzPzMuMu and thus provides a more accurate efficiency. 2016 data used for PARTIAL.
%\item Put Feynman diagrams?
%\item Redo plots in LHCb style %\textit{ML: los *.C no estan bien guardados}
%\item Some plots missing: Sensitifity for PARTIAL, fit for PARTIAL in the right for
% \item Keep filling appendices.
%\item References!
\item Avoid the use of ProbNNmu in the PARTIAL analysis, since it is not clear
whether it is correct to use it when the signal has a different Reco version than the background. Changed by DLL. 
Also removed Ghost probability for similar reason. The sensitivity is anyway very good already.
\end{itemize}
