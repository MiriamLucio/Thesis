The Standard Model (hereafter SM) of Particle Physics, mainly formulated in the \textcolor{red}{1970s}, is the quantum field theory that describes the strong and weak interactions. In Group Theory, it is represented by:
\begin{equation}
SU(3)_C\bigotimes SU(2)_T \bigotimes U(1)_Y
\end{equation}

Where the strong interaction lies in the SU(3)
